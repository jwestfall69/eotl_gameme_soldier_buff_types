# eotl_gameme_soldier_buff_types
This is a TF2 sourcemod plugin I wrote for the [EOTL](https://www.endofthelinegaming.com/) community.

When a solder deploys their buff, this plugin logs one of the following events based on which buff type they deployed.

soldierbuff_buff_banner<br/>
soldierbuff_battalions_backup<br/>
soldierbuff_concheror<br/>

These can then be added as actions in [GameMe](https://www.gameme.com) for tracking / points.  ie:

[Battalion's Backup Deployed](https://eotl.gameme.com/actioninfo/728)<br>
[Buff Banner Deployed](https://eotl.gameme.com/actioninfo/727)<br>
[Concheror Deployed](https://eotl.gameme.com/actioninfo/729)
