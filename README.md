# eotl_gameme_soldier_buff_types
This is a TF2 sourcemod plugin.

When a solder deploys their buff, this plugin logs one of the following events based on which buff type they deployed.

soldierbuff_buff_banner<br/>
soldierbuff_battalions_backup<br/>
soldierbuff_concheror<br/>

These can then be added as actions in gameme for tracking / points.
